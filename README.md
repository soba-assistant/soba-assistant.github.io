# SOBA Assistant

SOBA is an AI-powered plugin designed to support model-driven development directly within the Eclipse IDE. It combines the flexibility of Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) with the power of GPT-based Large Language Models (LLMs) to help users create, refine, and manipulate models using natural language interaction.
